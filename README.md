# PiAssist
This is a voice-assistant I built for the Raspberry Pi 4. 

Demo and presentation: https://bit.ly/39MIMlb.

## How to Use
This project requires a decent amount of dependecies. See my presentation link above for more info. After everything is installed, go to **main.py** and run the file and you can start speaking out commands.
